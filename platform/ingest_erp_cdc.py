"""Consume the ERP change stream and land it.

This is the boundary. Everything upstream -- Postgres, Debezium, Redpanda -- is
the world outside the lakehouse; everything downstream is inside it. The
consumer is the only thing that touches both, which is exactly where a real
ingestion job sits.

WHY A STREAM AND NOT A TABLE READ. The ERP is the one vendor whose value is its
history. Reading `erp.customer` directly would produce rows -- possibly even a
plausible count -- while testing something else entirely: a snapshot cannot
tell you that a customer was in Germany before they were in France, and SCD2
over a snapshot is SCD1 wearing a longer name.

WHAT IS PRESERVED, AND WHAT IS NOT. Counts survive real CDC: the same DML
produces the same events. LSNs, commit timestamps and Kafka offsets do not --
they differ every run, and nothing here asserts on them. `effective_date`
travels as DATA, which keeps the fixture's deliberate disagreement between
capture order and business order intact: a pipeline that sorts by the wrong one
still gets the wrong answer, which is the lesson this source exists to teach.
