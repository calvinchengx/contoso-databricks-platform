"""Pull Contoso POS over HTTP and land it verbatim.

This is where this platform stops inventing its own data. It used to write a
two-row CSV here and call it a landing; what it lands now is what the vendor
serves -- the same bytes fabric-platform-notebook-pipelines pulls, from the same pinned
simulator, because both consume contoso-sources. That is the whole reason gold
can be compared across the two runtimes at all: identical inputs, different
engines. Two green pipelines over different fixtures compare nothing.

Landed VERBATIM -- no parsing, no reshaping. Bronze's job is to be the bytes as
they arrived, so a question about the source can be answered without going back
to the vendor.

PAGED, and the pages are landed as separate parts rather than stitched back
into one file. Reassembling here would put the whole 95 MB export in this
process's memory -- the exact thing paging removes -- and a directory of parts
is what the engine wants to read anyway.
