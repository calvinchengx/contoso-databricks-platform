# Contract failures this platform can already explain, by contract name. Both
# of these are one emulator defect: decimal columns are registered in Unity
# Catalog with `type_name: DOUBLE`, so every money column in gold is READ as a
# binary float even though the Delta log, the Parquet physical type and
# `DESCRIBE` all still say `decimal(19,4)`. The numbers are right; their type
# is not. Remove an entry when its issue closes -- a cause that outlives its
# defect is a worse lie than no cause at all.
# NO KNOWN CAUSES. This mapped both money contracts to databricks-emulator#46,
# which was true for as long as this platform ran 0.2.4: decimal columns were
# registered in Unity Catalog with column metadata that could not express them,
# so they read as float and the type contract failed. 0.2.5 registers no column
# metadata, the Delta log is the schema again, and both contracts pass — so the
# cause is gone and naming it would be a worse lie than naming none.
#
# Repopulate it if this platform ever runs with a defect it is knowingly living
# with. A cause is only worth carrying while it is true, and the entry should
# die in the same change that makes it false, which is this one.

    # Delta log, the Parquet physical type and `DESCRIBE` all still say
    # `decimal(19,4)`. The planner trusts UC, so the column reads as a float.
    # See databricks-emulator#46 -- and note the emulator does this because
    # Sail's unity provider rejects `decimal(p,s)` outright, so the eventual
    # fix is probably upstream of both.

    # The cast recovers the value because money is defined to four decimal
    # places and the error is eight orders of magnitude below that. It does NOT
