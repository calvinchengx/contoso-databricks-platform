"""Pull Contoso Web over HTTP and land it verbatim.

THE SECOND VENDOR, and the reason there is one. A platform that ingests a
single source proves it can ingest a single source. Two vendors is where the
work actually starts: two credentials that rotate separately, two formats that
agree about nothing, and two customer lists describing overlapping people
without either system knowing the other exists.

WHAT THIS VENDOR SENDS, and none of it is smoothed over here:

  * JSON arrays, not the delimited text and JSON Lines the POS system ships
  * ORDERS ARE NESTED -- one order carries its own `lines` array, because the
    storefront thinks in baskets. Flattening is a decision, and it belongs
    downstream where it is visible, not in the step that records what arrived
  * NO CUSTOMER ID -- accounts are keyed on email, which is what makes joining
    this to the POS system a resolution problem rather than a join
  * `country` as the shopper typed it -- "United States", not "US"
